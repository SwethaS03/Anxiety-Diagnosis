 MODERATELY-SEVERE ANXIETY TREATMENT: You may start by seeing your primary care provider to find out if your anxiety could
 be related to your physical health. He or she can check for signs of an underlying
 medical condition that may need treatment. Psychotherapy involves working with a
 therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. It can be an effective treatment for
 anxiety. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the most effective form of
 psychotherapy for anxiety disorders. Generally a short-term treatment, CBT focuses
 on teaching you specific skills to improve your symptoms and gradually return to the
 activities you have avoided because of anxiety. CBT includes exposure therapy, in 
 which you gradually encounter the object or situation that triggers your anxiety so
 you build confidence that you can manage the situation and anxiety symptoms. END

 MODERATE ANXIETY TREATMENT: There are two main treatments for moderate anxiety disorder : Psychotherapy and lifestyle
 changes. While most people with this disorder undergo psychotherapy to get anxiety under
 control, lifestyle changes also make a huge difference. Use stress management and
 relaxation techniques. Visualization techniques, meditation and yoga are examples of
 relaxation techniques that can ease anxiety. Healthy eating — such as focusing on
 vegetables, fruits, whole grains and fish — may be linked to reduced anxiety, but more
 research is needed. Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs. These substances can cause or
 worsen anxiety. If you can’t quit on your own, see your doctor or find a support group to help
 you. Don't let worries isolate you from loved ones or activities. END

 SEVERE ANXIETY TREATMENT:
 You may need to see a mental health specialist. A psychologist and certain other mental 
 health professionals can diagnose anxiety and provide counseling (psychotherapy). Several 
 types of medications are used to help relieve symptoms. Certain antidepressants are also
 used to treat anxiety disorders. An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be 
 prescribed. In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe other types of 
 medications, such as sedatives, also called benzodiazepines, or beta blockers. 
 These medications are for short-term relief of anxiety symptoms and are not 
 intended to be used long term. Several herbal remedies have been studied as a treatment 
 for anxiety. Before taking herbal remedies or dietary supplements, talk to your doctor to 
 make sure they're safe for you and won't interact with any medications you take. END

 MILD ANXIETY TREATMENT:
 Keep a regular sleep pattern. Simple activities can help soothe the mental and physical signs of anxiety. These techniques
 include meditation, deep breathing exercises, long baths, resting in the dark, and yoga. Learning to manage stress can help
 limit potential triggers. Organize any upcoming pressures and deadlines, compile lists to make daunting tasks more manageable,
 and commit to taking time off from study or work. Make a list of the negative thoughts that might be cycling as a result of anxiety,
 and write down another list next to it containing positive, believable thoughts to replace them. Creating a mental image of
 successfully facing and conquering a specific fear can also provide benefits if anxiety symptoms relate to a specific cause,
 such as in a phobia. Physical exertion can improve self-image and release chemicals in the brain that trigger
 positive feelings. END
